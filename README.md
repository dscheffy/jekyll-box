# Jekyll Bo

Jekyll box provides a very simple vagrant based development, build and test environment for creating jekyll based static websites. 

## TODO

1. Update this `README` with better usage documentation.Z
2. Breakout current vagrant box in `/vagrant/base` to two separate boxes -- one base box provisioned with binaries and then packaged and installed locally, then a second one that uses that base box as it's base image.
